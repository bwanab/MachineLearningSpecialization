# MachineLearningSpecialization

This is a series of Pluto notebooks that reimplement in Julia the python examples from the Coursera course Machine Learning Specialization plus a Julia module that implements functions that are used in multiple notebooks.

The purpose of doing this work is strictly educational. By reimplementing, I find that I learn the material at a much deeper level than just reading code. It is provided here on a use at your own risk basis.
